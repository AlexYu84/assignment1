  		<p>Hi! My name is Alex and that is what I prefered to be called as well.</p>
  		<p>My OSU email address is yuale@oregonstate.edu.</p>
  		<p>My major is Computer Science and I'm a second year.</p>
  		<p>This is my first time every doing web developement so this is technically the most complicated thing I've done.</p>
      <p>I hope to learn the basics of web developement and the type of professions I can go into with it because I'm pretty intrigued by everything so far.</p>
      <p>I have not signed up for this classes piazza forum but that might change by the time I turn in this assignment.</p>
      <p>The most interesting fact about me is that I use to be a music person where I would compete in district and state competitions but I was never really that good because the highest I placed was 8th in state.</p>
